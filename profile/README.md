## The North Sea Transition Authority

We regulate and influence the oil and gas, offshore hydrogen, and carbon storage industries. We help drive North Sea energy transition, realising the significant potential of the UK Continental Shelf as a critical energy and carbon abatement resource. We hold industry to account on reducing emissions.
